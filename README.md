# 📈 Pearson Correlation Coefficient in Python

This repository provides a simple Python implementation of the Pearson correlation coefficient calculation, along with a unit test suite using Python’s built-in `unittest` framework.

## 🧮 Functionality

The core function computes the Pearson correlation coefficient between two numerical lists.

```python
def rcoefficient(a: list, b: list) -> float:
    """
    Returns the Pearson correlation coefficient between lists a and b.
    Raises ZeroDivisionError if either list has no variation.
    """

## 📌 Requirements

This project only uses standard Python libraries (no external dependencies):

Python 3.6+
